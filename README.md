# Pebble Game Algorithm

This project is designed to solve the classic pebble game or 'game of odds' problem. I created this project using java, and it contains multiple test cases to experiment upon with different values to test the algorithm. 


## Features

- Java backend to solve the pebble game problem.
- Multiple test files to validate the algorithm.
